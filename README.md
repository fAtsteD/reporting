# Create and send report

## File with report

Each line has time, name, type and project they are divided by space-dash-space:

```
[hour] [minute] - [name of task] - [name of type] - [name of project]
```

Example:

```
09 00 - 0123456: Do something - project of my life
10 45 - 0123456: Do something harder - project of my life
12 33 - lunch
...
```

> !!! Task, time, project do not have 'space dash space'. !!!

## Result of transformation

Example:

Type 1:

```
01.01.2020
  project of life (3.5 Ñ‡.):
    1.75h - 0123456: Do something
    1.75h - 0123456: Do something harder
...
```

## Config

Near the project (near file app.py) has to be file `config.json` with settings.

Setting that can be setted:

-   hour-report-path - path to file with tasks by hours
-   day-report-path - path to file where will be write tasks by project
-   omit-task - name of tasks that will be skipped
-   output-day-report - where to print result of report, can be 2 type of print (for disabling printing not include that type)
-   minute_round_to - for what number round minutes in the report. Default 25
-   jira - settings related for working with Jira:
    -   server - url to the server with Jira
    -   login - user login to the account
    -   password - user password to the account
    -   issue_key_base - (optional) prefix for all issue key. Default empty string
-   text-indent - indent in the beginning of line for task, type etc

Example:

```json
{
    "hour-report-path": "~/example-hours.txt",
    "day-report-path": "~/example-day-report.txt",
    "omit-task": ["lunch", "break"],
    "outputs-day-report": {
        "console": 1,
        "file": 1
    },
    "minute-round-to": 25,
    "text-indent": "  "
    "jira": {
        "server": "https://jira.example.domain.com/",
        "login": "test.user",
        "password": "password",
        "issue_key_base": "JRA-"
    }
}
```

## How it works

Program find tasks, their type and project. Task without project or type get in default name.

Some tasks like lunch can be ommitted. For that purpose they have to be in the config file in ommit array.
Task that has to be ommitted can be anything and have any symbols like another.

## JIRA

You must add 3 required configs for working with Jira: server, login, password.

### Worklog setting

Issue key searches by concatenate base in the settings (default empty string) and any number before double dots. All other information for setting worklog does not need.
