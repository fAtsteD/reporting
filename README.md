# Create and send report

## File with report

Each line has time, name, type and project they are divided by space-dash-space:

```
[hour] [minute] - [name of task] - [name of type] - [name of project]
```

Example:

```
09 00 - 0123456: Do something - project of my life
10 45 - 0123456: Do something harder - project of my life
12 33 - lunch
...
```

> !!! Task, time, project do not have 'space dash space'. !!!

## Result of transformation

Example:

Type 1:

```
01.01.2020
  project of life (3.5 Ñ‡.):
    1.75h - 0123456: Do something
    1.75h - 0123456: Do something harder
...
```

## Config

Example:

```json
{
    "hour-report-path": "~/example-hours.txt",
    "omit-task": ["lunch", "break"],
    "outputs-day-report": {
        "console": 1,
        "file": 1
    },
    "minute-round-to": 25,
    "text-indent": "  ",
    "jira": {
        "server": "https://jira.example.domain.com/",
        "login": "test.user",
        "password": "password",
        "issue-key-base": [
            "JRA-"
        ]
    },
    "dictionary": {
        "task": {
            "l": "lunch"
        },
        "type": {},
        "project": {}
    },
    "reporting": {
        "login": "test",
        "password": "pass",
        "api-url": "https://reporting.example.com/api",
        "suburl-auth": "example/path",
        "suburl-logout" : "common/logout",
        "suburl-categories": "example/path",
        "suburl-projects": "example/path",
        "suburl-positions": "example/path",
        "suburl-init": "example/path",
        "suburl-get-report": "example/path",
        "suburl-add-task": "example/path",
    },
    "default-type": "Development",
    "default-project": "Project"
}
```

## How it works

Program find tasks, their type and project. Task without project or type get in default name.

Some tasks like lunch can be ommitted. For that purpose they have to be in the config file in ommit array.
Task that has to be ommitted can be anything and have any symbols like another.

## JIRA

You must add 3 required configs for working with Jira: server, login, password.

### Worklog setting

Issue key searches by concatenate base in the settings (default empty string) and any number before double dots. All other information for setting worklog does not need.

## Reporting

Add requests through API.
Firstly do requests for data then it can do what you need.

New requests can be added in the api then used in reporting.
